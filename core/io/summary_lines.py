"""core/io/summary_lines.py — the summary-mode line presenter.

Single home for the grammar of ``--output summary``: one compact,
append-only line per run event (phase start/end, plan contract, gate
verdicts, subtask receipts, auto-fix, gates rollup, handoff cards,
resume, delivery). Every formatter is a **pure, side-effect-free**
function that returns a ``str`` — nothing here prints, opens files, or
touches process state, so the module imports clean and callers stay in
control of when and where a line is emitted.

Design rules mirror :mod:`core.io.pipeline_block`:

* **Colour only through :func:`core.io.ansi.paint`.** No raw CSI escape
  literals and no inline palette-constant f-string interpolation.
  ``color=None`` follows the shared auto-detect/override policy;
  explicit booleans force the outcome. Stderr-bound lines pass
  ``stream=sys.stderr`` so auto-detect consults the right descriptor
  (see :func:`core.io.ansi.paint`).
* **One glyph vocabulary.** Every line is prefixed by exactly one glyph
  from the fixed set ``▶ ✓ ✗ ⚠ ┌ ═ ↺ ·``. The glyph carries state at a
  glance even with colour stripped (tmux logs, CI capture, pipes).
* **Truncation is for free text only.** :func:`_truncate_tail` clips a
  free-text tail (a goal, a summary, a headline, a reason) to a visible
  column budget with a trailing ``…``. Structured tokens — ids, enum
  verdicts, phase names, gate names, handoff ids, paths — are never
  truncated, so they always read in full.

This module is intentionally not wired to any caller here; the phase and
run surfaces adopt it in later steps. Keeping the grammar in one place
stops summary f-strings from scattering across the orchestration body.

    """Clip a free-text tail to ``cols`` visible columns, adding ``…``.

    A free-text tail is plain content in the summary grammar: the presenter
    colours only glyphs and enum tokens, never the tail. Any ANSI escape in
    an incoming tail is therefore incidental (raw agent/contract text), so it
    is stripped up front via :func:`core.io.ansi.strip_ansi`. Stripping first
    means the clip measures true visible width AND can never leave a dangling
    SGR code that would colour-leak into the following separators or lines —
    a truncated coloured tail cannot lose its trailing reset because no
    escape survives at all. Internal runs of whitespace — including newlines —
    collapse to single spaces so a multi-line value can never break the
    single-line append grammar.

    The result's visible width is at most ``cols``: when clipping is needed
    the ``…`` occupies the final column (``text[:cols - 1] + '…'``). A tail
    already within budget is returned untouched. This helper is applied ONLY
    to free text — never to ids, enum verdicts, phase or gate names, handoff
    ids, or paths, which must always read in full.
